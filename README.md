### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...? 
  I do not have any work, if you consider the fact that I am just an undergrad cheering to jump into the wild world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
  Well, I am trying to learn anything I can, however, I often get too busy to achieve them. For the majority, I am currently focusing on Physics, especially experimental physics.
- 😵‍💫 Preparing GRE general test for the prospective graduate study in US.
- 💬 Ask me about nearly everything within my major. Maybe quantum mechanics? Semiconductor physics? Solid state physics? Electrodynamics..etc. I like to answer questions, except for statistical mechanics(How could people just create such horrific things?).
- 📫 How to reach me: Can Github leave the insite message? Since this is the first time for me to use Github...(Well, I had used it before only to get access to some open source projects) IF can't, send me some info via email: JaggerGao@protonmail.com, since I am busy, I will try to check the mailbox once a month.🤓
- 🥳 I wish to start a personal website on the Github, and I am looking for the details for it. Maybe the website could be a suitable place to leave some records for my life.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I almost know nothing about coding(Maybe some TCAD software and CAD software experiences?).
- My [blog](bigtigeraowu.github.io)
- 
🥳 Hve fun!
